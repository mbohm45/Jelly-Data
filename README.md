# Jelly-Data

Welcome to team jelly bean!

Here we have data from experiments on *Aurelia aurita* polyps run at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre in BC, Canada to fulfill the requirements of our Directed Studies course. 
We drugged our jellies with estradiol, caffiene or both for 12 days and measured their responses every three days.
In this repository you will find folders named:
  1. Analyses, containing all the code necessary to run the analyses that we completed on our data. 
  2. Data, containing all the data we collected.
  3. Paper, containing the report that we submitted as part of this course.
  4. Results, containing the code necessary to create the figures that we used to visualize our results in the paper, as well as summary tables.


Have fun with our data and feel free to drop any questions or comments in the discussion!
