# Jelly-Data

Welcome to team jelly bean!

Here we have data from experiments on *Aurelia aurita* polyps and ephyra run at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre in BC, Canada. 
We drugged our jellies with estradiol, caffiene or both for 12 days and measured their responses every three days.
All the ephyra died ... (we think a parasite killed them?), so in this repository you will find primarily polyp data analyses.
We built three sets of models for our data (see proportional, count no total and count with total documents) and then picked the most representative model set.
Then we made some fun graphs :) 

Have fun with our data and feel free to drop any questions or comments in the discussion!
